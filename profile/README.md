## Welcome to the Java User Group Panama

The **Java User Group Panama (JUG Panama)** is the meeting point for the **[Java Community](https://dev.java/community/)** in our country to **connect, communicate, and collaborate** with developer peers.

As part of a **[global network of volunteer organizations](https://dev.java/community/jugs/)** found on almost every continent, we strive to distribute Java-related knowledge, share resources, and build a more inclusive community for everyone interested in the JVM ecosystem.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to strengthen the developer landscape in Panama by providing a platform to **expand Java Technology expertise** and inspire innovation.

We achieve this by hosting talks with industry leaders and local experts, organizing community meetups, hands-on workshops, and panel discussions—fostering collaboration both online and in person.
